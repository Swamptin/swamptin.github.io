# Rust Learning Part 1

I've been learning the Rust language on and off for a few months now. I've made one little project in it, a [ToDo app](https://github.com/Swamptin/rust_todo_cli_tool)
that runs in the commandline. It's a fun little language to work in and I enjoy learning it. My close friend Colm sent me on a project that purports to be a great
way to learn the language. This blog post is going to document my experience following that project.

## 100 Exercises to learn Rust
The project can be found [here](https://rust-exercises.com/). The project has some handy little tools to help you track your progress. Just install the
workshop-runner tool and run the `wr` command to see what the next test is. When you run the command it prints out a nice encouraging message and then either points
you to the next problem, or shows you the error details to help you debug the issue.

The rather verbose error messages from Rust are very helpful for the most part. I do find that sometimes they can be a little intense, but if you take the time to
sit with them you can usually see the solution clearly in front of you. It's one of the best learning tools for learning the language.
