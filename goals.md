# What is this about?

I've had many ideas about blogs. I've created blogs before but failed at
maintaining them. Life got in the way. These things do happen, and that's okay
too. This is a renewed attempt at creating something.

As it happens my tastes and goals have changed since I launched my
[swamptin.ie](swamptin.ie) blog. This means I feel the need to use another blog
altogether to try and do this a bit better. So what is this? This is a blog in 
which I will explore languages and tools for specific needs or interests. There
is no set goal per say of this blog. I am a jack of all trades. I like learning
about stuff just to see what it's about. 

So this is a rambling blog of some projects, and some thoughts. I'll try to keep
it tech related. All my projects are, most of my thoughts are. But I'm not
making any promises.

Hopefully you'll stick around and see something your interested in. Who knows,
we might learn somethings together. Come along, and let's see where this goes.
