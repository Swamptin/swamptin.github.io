# Who am I?

I'm just some guy, you know?

I go by Swamptin on Mastodon. I've been working in tech for 8 years now. I've
tried my hand a lot of things but I've yet to find that "one true thing". I
doubt I ever will to be fair, there's too much that's interesting. I've wanted a
blog, somewhere to explore tech publicly, for years. I've always struggled with
overly complex solutions for my needs. This might work though.

This blog at the moment will be mostly about my journey learning Rust. Why am I
learning Rust? It's fun. Work is a four letter word and isn't really fun at the
moment. Rust isn't really useful for getting work. It may have been a few years
ago, but now? Now it's just fun. Nobody is hiring for it. I can just enjoy learning
in those brief moments where I have time to try.
