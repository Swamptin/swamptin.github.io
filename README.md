### Who am I?

I'm just some guy, you know? 

I go by Swamptin on Mastodon. I've been working in tech for 8 years now. I've 
tried my hand a lot of things but I've yet to find that "one true thing". I
doubt I ever will to be fair, there's too much that interesting. I've wanted a
blog, somewhere to explore tech publicly, for years. I've always struggled with
overly complex solutions for me needs. This might work though.
