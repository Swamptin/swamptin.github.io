# Basic homepage index

I currently have two blogs. If you've landed here you have a choice. Either my [Mountain Biking race blog](mtb/index.md) or my [Tech blog](tech/index.md) which currently is focused on my experiences with CTF challenges and practical learning tools like Try Hack Me.

I hope you enjoy whichever you choose.
