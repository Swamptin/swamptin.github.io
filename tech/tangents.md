# The Importance of Tangents

Let me be very clear, right from the off, tangents and rabbit holes are separate things. Two sides of a damn near identical coin. Let's be honest, one can very easily form off the back of the other. But what I want to talk about here is the importance of tangents in relation to exploring areas of TryHackMe (THM).

One of the first lessons in the "Complete Beginner" track is an introduction to research. In it there's sections about online resources like exploit-db.com, searchsploit (a linux command line tool that uses the former), and the Mitre website of CVEs(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). There's sections about the importance of manual (man) pages in Linux and how to use them effectively. But right at the bottom, in the closing thoughts, and easily overlooked is a link to another lesson on Google Dorking. This, is a tangent. It's a very good tangent. When you see something like this, it's worth sidetracking yourself for a while to learn about something new.

I think it's important to remember that learning like this should be fun. The fun comes from following interesting tangents. I will also say that if you can find a community of friends to do monthly challenges, that is also a good way to keep it interesting. Anything that helps you learn in a fun way is a win.We will all stumble, but let's keep stumbling forward.
