# The Premise

There are plenty of walkthroughts for all sorts of capture the flag platforms. They range from text writeups to videos from legends of the hobby like Ippsec.
This is not those.

I will not promise that I won't ever do a traditional writeup/walkthrough of a challenge from Hack The Box or Try Hack Me. But if I'm honest, that's not what I'm setting out to do. I want to openly and honestly report how I'm getting on with stuff like Try Hack Me. Some of it will make sense to me and come as second nature. Others won't. But I want to bring you along in this journey. Show you that you're not alone in being confused or slipping up on simple things.

We can stumble forward together.
